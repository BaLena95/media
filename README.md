# Personalisation for (Public) Media - ADS Master
# Focus on Recommender Systems

# Content

Personalizing content in order to cater to a wide variety of audience clusters is a key effort in the
media industry. Referred to as “recommender systems”, these systems have become an integral part
of our daily media consumption. The recommender systems developed operate in specific contexts
and reflect particular norms and values (both intentionally and unintentionally). This course
combines the approaches value-sensitive design and algorithmic affordances and interfaces in the
development of recommender systems for (public) media. More specifically, it explores the interplay
between values, technologies and stakeholders.
